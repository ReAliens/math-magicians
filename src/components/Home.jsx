      Mathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space, and
      change. Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and
      establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
      definitions. There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as
      numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The
      mathematician Benjamin Peirce called mathematics &#8220;the science that
      draws necessary conclusions &#8220;. Albert Einstein, on the other hand,
      stated that &#8220;as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality,
      they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to
      reality. &#8220; Through abstraction and logical reasoning mathematics
      evolved from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study
      of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has
      been a human activity for as far back as written records exist. Rigorous
      arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid
      &#8242;s Elements. Mathematics continued to develop, in fitful bursts,
      until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacted with new
      scientific discoveries, leading to an acceleration in research that
      continues to the present day.
